NGFW IP Shun POC
## Using a [Tines](https://tines.com) workflow, a security analyst submits IOCs. This action creates a [MISP](https://github.com/MISP) event and a ServiceNow incident.  After processing, IPs are pushed to the GitHub repo tines folder.  GitHub actions initiate python scripts to write the IPs to an index with the IP address, entry date, and the expiry date (+30 days). Another script reads the index csv and, based on the current date, generates an ip shun text file and a md5 hash file.  These files are pushed to an S3 bucket, which the NGFW consumes as a custom security intelligence feed.
